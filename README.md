# Little Big CI

## Overview

The scripts presented at GTAC 2008.

Right now you can fetch these files, run ```test-bootstrap``` and on my Windows 7 Home laptop, 
you're good to go with the canned parameters.

### Prerequisites

Windows XP, 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 2008?
Full set of SVN binaries on the path.

### Nice to Haves

TortoiseSVN is a nice touch: Ensure the working copy and repo formats match.

### Outputs

You will get

 + an example SVN repo with an example project
 + an example project checkout and test machine checkout
 + 3 scheduled tasks performing the core of the CI process
