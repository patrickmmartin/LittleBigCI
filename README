Little Big CI

Overview

The scripts presented at GTAC 2008.

Right now you can fetch these files, run "test-bootstrap" and on my Windows 7 Home laptop, you're good to go.

Prerequisites

Full set of SVN binaries on the path.
TortoiseSVN is a nice touch.
Ensure the working copy and repo formats match.

Output

You will get:
 * an example SVN repo with an example project
 * an example project checkout and test machine checkout
 * 3 scheduled tasks performing the core of the CI process
